# Model Files for Affective Computing Project

The model files for this project are too large to store directly in this repository.

You can download the required model files from the following [GitHub Release](https://github.com/akashshingha850/affective_computing_project/releases)

Please download the model files and place them in this folder before running the project.

## Instructions:
1. Go to the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/akashshingha850/affective_computing_project/releases).
2. Download the required files (e.g., `.onnx`, `.engine`).
3. Move the downloaded files into this folder followed by a model folder (ie:`base_dir/models/mrl_vgg16/vgg16.onnx`).

If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, please refer to the main repository's [README.md](https://github.com/akashshingha850/affective_computing_project) for more details.
