## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Utilizes the MRL Infrared Eye Dataset, with images categorized as "Open-Eyes" and "Close-Eyes" to train the model.
2. **Model Training**: VGG16 model trained on PyTorch, optimized and exported to ONNX for compatibility with TensorRT.
3. **Model Optimization**: TensorRT optimizations, including precision reduction (FP32 to FP16) and layer fusion, ensure efficient performance on the Jetson platform.
4. **Pipeline**: 
   - **Face Detection**: Detects driverâ€™s face in each frame.
   - **Eye Detection**: Identifies eye regions for classification.
   - **Eye State Classification**: Determines eye state as open or closed.
5. **Feedback System**: Provides escalating alerts with LEDs and a buzzer based on continuous eye state monitoring.

## Performance

- **Accuracy**: Achieves 99% accuracy with high precision, recall, and F1-scores.
- **Latency**: Averages 14.4 ms per frame, providing smooth real-time performance.
- **FPS**: Optimized with TensorRT to reach 70 FPS on the Jetson Orin Nano.

## Limitations

- **Low-Light Performance**: Reduced accuracy in low-light conditions; can be improved with IR sensors.
- **Driver Identification**: Detects only the largest face; future versions may include driver-specific tracking.

## Future Improvements

- **Pose Estimation**: Detects fatigue indicators like head tilt and posture.
- **System Expansion**: Integration with in-vehicle safety systems for automatic interventions (e.g., speed reduction).
- **Enhanced Model Performance**: Training with a diverse dataset to improve accuracy across various conditions.
